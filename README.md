## My Personal Developer Portfolio

Developed with Next.js and Sass. Posts are written in markdown and rendered with react-markdown and react-syntax-highlighter.

Live at: [https://renebitter.github.io/portfolio](https://renebitter.github.io/portfolio)

basePath configured in next.config.js to repository's name since it is intended to be hosted on github pages. To access it locally add the repository name to the url. e.g. "http://localhost:3000/portfolio".

Dark mode also applies to blog post's preformatted text code.

Third party static contact form (formspree).

Todo:
- Dark mode / useLocalStorage
- Fix/Add animation to mobile navbar (background when open)
- Parallax? (About me image)

Less important:

- Check for prop drilling vs context?
- Add loading animation to sending message on contact form?
- Replace AOS by framer-motion?
