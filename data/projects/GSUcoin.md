## Description

GSU Protocol is a decentralized CDP (collateralized debt position) protocol which uses multi crypto collateral available on the Ethereum Blockchain approved by the "GSU Protocol" to issue a stable unit GSU Stable Coin (GSUc).
This project is a clone of oasis.app with some new feature. So mainly i've updated the frontend and integrated new functionality.
